#Jasper Report 
Jasper Report is an open source java reporting engine, is Java based and doesn't have its own expression syntax.

As JasperReports is a Java class library, and is not meant for end users, but rather is targeted towards developers who need to add reporting capabilities to their applications.

##JRXML

JasperReports reports are defined in an XML file format, called JRXML, which can be hand-coded, generated, or designed using a tool ( For this project we will use iReport). The file format is defined by a Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML schema for newer versions, providing limited interoperability.

The main difference between using XML and a .jasper file is that the XML file should be compiled at runtime using the JasperCompileManager class.
